# Code Analysis for Snippet Versions

## Q1 (a) Lexical and Syntax Analysis of Code Snippet Version 1

### Lexical Analysis
- **Description**: The process of breaking down the source code into tokens. Tokens represent logical groupings of characters such as keywords, identifiers, literals, etc.
- **Example**:
  - `int` → keyword
  - `x` → identifier
  - `=`, `+`, `;` → operators/punctuation

### Syntax Analysis
- **Description**: This involves checking the code structure according to the rules of the programming language (usually based on a context-free grammar).
- **Example**:
  - Ensure that expressions like `int x = 10;` follow the rules of declarations and assignments.

## Q1 (b) Intermediate Code Generation and Code Generation for Code Snippet Version 1

### Intermediate Code Generation
- **Description**: Translating high-level code into a lower-level intermediate representation that is easier for machine interpretation but still abstracted from actual machine code.
- **Example**: 
  - Transforming `x = a + b;` into an intermediate representation like `t1 = a + b`, followed by `x = t1`.

### Code Generation
- **Description**: The final step where the intermediate code is converted into machine-specific assembly or bytecode that can be executed by a processor or a virtual machine.
- **Example**:
  - Assembly output for `x = a + b` could look like:
    ```
    MOV R1, a
    ADD R1, b
    MOV x, R1
    ```

## Q2 Lexical, Syntax, Intermediate Code, and Code Generation for Code Snippet Version 2

### Lexical Analysis
- **Description**: Tokenization of the source code, similar to Version 1 but applied to a different code snippet.
- **Example**:
  - Tokenizing `float y = 5.0;` would break it down into tokens like `float`, `y`, `=`, `5.0`, and `;`.

### Syntax Analysis
- **Description**: Parsing the tokens into a syntax tree or another hierarchical structure to validate the code’s grammar.
- **Example**:
  - Ensure the structure of `float y = 5.0;` is grammatically correct.

### Intermediate Code Generation
- **Description**: Generating an abstract form of the code, such as three-address code (TAC) or static single assignment (SSA).
- **Example**:
  - `y = 5.0` might turn into an intermediate instruction like `t2 = 5.0`, followed by `y = t2`.

### Code Generation
- **Description**: Transforming the intermediate code into machine-specific instructions.
- **Example**:
  - Assembly or bytecode for `y = 5.0` might look like:
    ```
    MOV R2, #5.0
    MOV y, R2
    ```
